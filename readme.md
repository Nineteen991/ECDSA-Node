## ECDSA Node (practice)

Since the wallet transfer app doesn't actually connect to 
a real wallet. I created 3 fake wallet addresses with 
corresponding private keys.

Only those addresses will be accepted. Anything else will
throw an error.

After transferring money from 1 wallet to another, the 
wallet balance will automatically update.
